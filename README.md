PREDICTION OF WINE QUALITY - DEEP LEARNING

The given winequality dataset is data cleaned and preprocessed by using pandas library.
The exploratory data anlysis is visualized using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
Then the preprocessed dataset is trained by Deep learning algorithms are CNN, RNN, SVM.
Finally, the predicted wine quality is deployed in streamlit application.

Skills : Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, Streamlit.
